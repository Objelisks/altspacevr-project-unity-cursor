# AltspaceVR Programming Project - Unity Cursor

## Features

3D cursor is fully implemented.

Cursor can pick up objects by pressing down the left mouse button.

New scene included.

## Notes

Press tab ingame to switch to the other scene.

Hold shift to turn around.

## Library scene

This scene was inspired by the recent update to https://libraryofbabel.info/ and my own love of Borges' work. The rooms each contain books that can be picked up using the cursor. Upon entering a room the connecting rooms are generated, providing the illusion of an infinite space.
